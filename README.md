## Build Extension from Source
You can build the extension in 3 ways:
1. `cmd/new`    - updates extension version in manifest files and creates a new branch with provided version number
1. `cmd/build`  - build locally. You'll need to have `npm` and `zip` installed on your machine
1. `cmd/podman` - bulid with Podman container engine. You'll need to have `podman` and `podman-compose` installed on your machine
1. `cmd/docker` - bulid with Docker container engine. You'll need to have `docker` installed on your machine

It will generate `firefox.zip`, `chrome.zip` and `source.zip` files inside of your project's root.

## Start working on the source code
All necessary scripts are in package.json file. You need to have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) JavaScript package managers.

### Installation
**Clone the repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tab-guardian/tab-guardian.git && cd tab-guardian
```

**Install all dependencies**
```bash
npm i
```

**Duplicate `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**Check `.env` file**
Check your `.env` file and set `VITE_DEV_LOCALE` to language that you prefer.


### Code style
Don't worry about the code style. We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to format the code. You can run it manually by executing `yarn prettier` or `npm run prettier` to format the code, or `yarn prettier-check` or `npm run prettier-check` to check if the code is formatted correctly.

## Contribute
### NPM Commands Available
All necessary scripts are in `package.json` file. I'm using Vite here.

#### Watch File Changes
Start a development server with Vite and serve your source files via native ES modules.
```bash
npm run dev
```

#### Compile to Production
Compile files for production or compile them in order to check how the extension works in the browser.
```bash
npm run build
```

#### Check files with Prettier
```bash
npm run prettier
```

### With a Container Engine
> [!NOTE]
> If you use [üê≥ Docker](https://app.docker.com/) instead of [ü¶¶ Podman](https://podman.io/), just replace `podman-compose` with `docker compose`, and `podman` with `docker` in code examples below.

#### Build the Image
To build the image, run this command:
```bash
podman-compose build
```

#### Create node_modules locally
```bash
docker compose run --rm app npm i
```

#### Run the Container
After the image is build, you can run a container from that image. Run this command:
```bash
podman-compose up -d
```

After the container is created, it will run the development server which is available on `http://localhost:3000` with hot reloading.

#### Enter the Container
To enter inside the container, run this command:
```bash
podman-compose exec app sh
```

You'll be able to run [NPM commands](#npm-commands-available) inside of the container.

#### Delete the Container
When you are done working, you can delete the container by running this:
```bash
podman-compose down
```

## Terminology
Here are some words that you need to know in order to undetstand the context of the app:
- `group` group is a collection of links (tabs)
- `link` in the context of this app is a link that is stored in your group
- `tab` tab is what users see in their browsers. After storing those tabs in a group they become `links`
